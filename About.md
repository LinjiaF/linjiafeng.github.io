### Academic Experience

#### Malaria Modeling using Machine Learning, Research Assistant, collaborate with Prof.Lelys Bravo(Statistics, UIUC) and Prof. Yasmin Rubio-Palis (Health Sciences, Universidad de Carabobo \
This research project analyzes environmental drivers for several species of malaria parasites mosquitoes, imputed the missing data of mosquito activity using linear, stochastic and machine learning methods; Applied Generalized Linear Models for Count Time Series approach to study the number of malaria cases based on mosquito abundance and climate drivers, including such factors as temperature, rainfall, and El Niño.

Working Paper: “Using machine learning to overcome mosquito collections missing data for malaria modeling” with Lelys Bravo, Yasmin Rubio-Palis, et al.


#### Quantifying Economic Impact of Covid-19, supervised by Prof. Shihan Xie (Economics, UIUC) \
This research project quantifies the economic impact of Covid-19 by studying the change of employment growth and housing price growth before and after the pandemic. I have explored topics like: \
How factors like different income groups and work-from-home difficulty index impact employment? \
Examines factors such as population density that may affect housing price growth. \
The relationship between inflation rate and unemployment rate or housing price growth in recent decades before the pandemic with a fixed-effect model using a panel data.
